                <h4>Biography</h4>
                    <p>My name is Michael Pszonka and I am a first semester Computer Science Masters student at Stevens.  I grew up in Parsippany, NJ
                    and moved to Houston in 2013.  I recently moved back and have been working as an accountant for the past few years since graduating
                     college, but now I am very interested in transitioning into a roll in data science.  To that end I've decided to go to graduate school
                    full time, while also continuing to work full time job.  This has been going well so far, but the schedule is brutal and I'm hoping to be able to leave my job next semester to continue 
                    working on my degree full time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Been enjoying the class so far though. I've found Promises to actually be really interesting and not something that I've ever
                    come across when I was learning some web development on my own.

                <h4>Family</h4>
                <p>My mother and father are Lorraine and Richard Pszonka.  My little brother, Richard is two years younger then me and is a nurse.
                    Why is my younger brother named after my father instead of me you might ask?  I have no idea and I've never really been given an 
                    a satisfactory answer on the matter haha.  I also have a half sister named Michelle who is about 15 years older then me, who has 
                    a 14 year old daugher named Emily and a 12 year old son named Thomas.

                <h4>Sports Teams</h4>
                <p>I grew up a huge New Jersey Nets fan, but now that they've picked up and decided to leave for Brooklyn they're dead to me.  Glad to 
                    see that they've basically been terrible since lol!  Also a big Devils, Giants and Houston Astros fan (I picked up baseball while
                    living in Texas).
