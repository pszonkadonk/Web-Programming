            <h4>Biography</h4>
                <section>My name is Michael Pszonka and I am a first semester Computer Science Masters student at Stevens.  I've been working
                    as an accountant for the past few years since graduating college, but now I am very interested in transitioning into a roll
                    in data science.  To that end I've decided to go to graduate school full time, while also continuing to work full time job.  This
                    has been going well so far, but the schedule is brutal and I'm hoping to be able to leave my job next semester to continue 
                    working on my degree full time.
                </section>
                <section>Been enjoying the class so far though. I've found Promises to actually be really interesting and not something that I've ever
                    come across when I was learning some web development on my own.
