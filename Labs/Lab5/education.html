                <h4>Parsippany Hills High School</h4>
                <p>I went to high school at Parsippany Hills High School and graduated in 2008. My favorite class was definitely
                    my AP Economics class in my senior year.  Nothing specific comes to mind, but I always remember having the greatest
                    time screwing around at school.  I don't think I've ever spent more time in tears laughing as I did back in high school!

                <h4>Rutgers University</h4>
                <p>I did my undergraduate studies at Rutgers University and graduated with my Bachelors in Finance in 2012.  My favorite class in college
                    was actually a random history class on the Hebrew Bible.  It was really interesting studying the ancient world described in the
                    the bible from a historical context rather then a religous one, much in the same way we study Ancient Greence through the Iliad 
                    and the Odyssey in Literature classes.  Favorite memory was definately Rutgersfest 2010!
